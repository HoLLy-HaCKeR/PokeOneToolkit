# PokeOneToolkit
Allows for sniffing and editing PokeOne traffic.

## Features
#### Enabled by default
* View all traffic in convenient JSON format.
  * This includes viewing the coordinates and GUID of hidden items and NPCs.
* Remotely "talk to" any NPCs, item or object in the same map (note that maps are shared across interiors).
* Modify the line-of-sight of all NPCs, so you're never detected by trainers or blocking NPCs.
* Spoof clothes or outfit (client-side only).
* Remotely trigger scripts.

#### Enabled with source edit
* Disable all NPCs.
* Any other functionality you can think of.

## Compilation
Place MAPAPI.dll and PSXAPI.dll in the `DLLs` folder and compile using Visual Studio 2017.
